This folder contains the code that will use the predictor model exported from the Jupiter notebook to predict a price output based on the required input features.

The server.py file will contain the flask API as an intermediary between the web UI and the model.

So that input can be taken from a user, and the estimated price target can be rendered.

The util.py file is referenced by the server.py file for necessary functions
